# CODE RED Controller and Sensor Portfolio 

This project documents my work as the developer of firetruck-themed controllers for the **CODE RED** video game interactive experience. I created 4 controllers and 4 stations. Each controller is a fully custom wooden firetruck that I wired, soldered, and integrated with embedded joysticks and buttons. Each station was wired, soldered, and integrated with embedded magnetic sensors.

##  Project Summary
The electronics I worked with include:
- Embedded wiring and soldered circuits  
- 4 Hall-effect magnetic sensors (KY-003) 
- 4 Push buttons  
- 4 Joysticks with 2 inputs each for left and right movement
- Teensy microcontroller for USB keyboard inputs  

These controllers were used to interact with a projection-mapped cube for a firefighting game, where players move magnetic props over sensors at corners of the cube in order to indicate where they are in the space, and then control their player using a joystick and button on each firetruck.

## My Contributions to the Final Project 
- Assisted in creating wiring diagrams and hardware layout  
- Programmed the Teensy logic handling magnetic sensors, joysticks, and button inputs
- Testing and Iterated upon input keys, input positions, and inputs used
- Collaborated with game developers to match input requirements
